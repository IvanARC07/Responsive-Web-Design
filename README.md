# Responsive-Web-Design

The motive behind this project is to **"sharpen the knife."** As a seasoned developer, I've had the opportunity to work with many advanced and modern technologies.

The intention behind this project is to revisit the fundamentals to build more accessible and user-friendly websites and apps.
